GUI for FSL's Brain Extraction Tool (BET)

BET is a well know tool included in the FSL software package (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FNIRT/UserGuide) for extracting the brain of MRI images of the head. It often requires some tweaking to obtain the optimal parameters for the extraction. The current tool facilitates this process by allowing to interactively set the parameters and visualize the results.

This was a small project in python3 that was mainly aimed at familiarizing myself with the syntax and methods in python.
